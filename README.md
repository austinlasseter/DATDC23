### Class 1: What is Data Science

**Python Resources:**
* [Codecademy's Python course](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python): Good beginner material, including tons of in-browser exercises.
* [DataQuest](https://dataquest.io/): Similar interface to Codecademy, but focused on teaching Python in the context of data science.
* [Google's Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/): Slightly more advanced, including hours of useful lecture videos and downloadable exercises (with solutions).
* [A Crash Course in Python for Scientists](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/rpmuller/5920182): Read through the Overview section for a quick introduction to Python.
* [Python for Informatics](http://www.pythonlearn.com/book.php): A very beginner-oriented book, with associated [slides](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B7X1ycQalUnyal9yeUx3VW81VDg&usp=sharing) and [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlRFEj9H3Oj4JXIwMwN1_ss1Tk8wZShEJ).
* [Python Tutor](http://pythontutor.com/): Allows you to visualize the execution of Python code.
* [My code isn't working](http://www.tecoed.co.uk/uploads/1/4/2/4/14249012/624506_orig.png) is a great flowchart explaining how to debug Python errors.
* [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) is Python's "classic" style guide, and is worth a read if you want to write readable code that is consistent with the rest of the Python community.

**Advanced Python Material:**
* [Want to understand Python's comprehensions? Think in Excel or SQL](http://blog.lerner.co.il/want-to-understand-pythons-comprehensions-think-like-an-accountant/) may be helpful if you are still confused by list comprehensions.
* If you want to understand Python at a deeper level: Ned Batchelder's [Loop Like A Native](http://nedbatchelder.com/text/iter.html), [Python Names and Values](http://nedbatchelder.com/text/names1.html),
Raymond Hettinger's [Transforming Code into Beautiful, Idiomatic Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSGv2VnC0go) and [Python Epiphanies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi9NpxAvYSs) are excellent presentations.
* [Everything is an object in Python](https://www.jeffknupp.com/blog/2013/02/14/drastically-improve-your-python-understanding-pythons-execution-model/)

**Resources:**
* For a useful look at the different types of data scientists, read [Analyzing the Analyzers](http://cdn.oreillystatic.com/oreilly/radarreport/0636920029014/Analyzing_the_Analyzers.pdf) (32 pages).
* For some thoughts on what it's like to be a data scientist, read these short posts from [Win-Vector](http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2012/09/on-being-a-data-scientist/) and [Datascope Analytics](http://datascopeanalytics.com/what-we-think/2014/07/31/six-qualities-of-a-great-data-scientist).
* [Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/)
* [Data Science vs Statistics](http://bit.ly/1FrZX80)
* [15 Books every Data Scientist Should Read](http://bit.ly/1Fs0bvW)
* [50+ Free Data Science Books](http://bit.ly/1Fs0kzr)
* [Building Data Science Teams](http://oreil.ly/1G1s6Oc)
* [Doing Data Science](http://amzn.to/1MHM1Jz)
* [Getting Started with Data Science](http://treycausey.com/getting_started.html)
* Quora has a [data science topic FAQ](https://www.quora.com/Data-Science) with lots of interesting Q&A.
* Keep up with local data-related events through the Data Community DC [event calendar](http://www.datacommunitydc.org/calendar) or [weekly newsletter](http://www.datacommunitydc.org/newsletter).
* [Stack Overflow - Developer Survey Results 2017](http://stackoverflow.com/insights/survey/2017/?utm_source=so-owned&utm_medium=hero&utm_campaign=dev-survey-2017&utm_content=hero-ind-ques)
* [Nate Silver on the Art and Science of Prediction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE4qCJBgfIk&index=22&list=LLGUFXF_Wex-mp-gpXFPYZEQ)
* Data science business [application diagram](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1750/1*_r8gzWK6v7fbU1YqCfZ7WQ.png)
* [Three waves of AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O01G3tSYpU)

**Material for Next Class:**
* [Setting up Python for machine learning: scikit-learn and IPython Notebook](https://youtu.be/IsXXlYVBt1M?t=4m57s) This videos includes an overview of Jupyter Notebook, which is used in the homework assignment.
* [Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is an excellent book for learning Git. Read the first two chapters to gain a deeper understanding of version control and basic commands.
* Work through GA's friendly [command line tutorial](http://generalassembly.github.io/prework/command-line/#/) using Terminal (Linux/Mac) or Git Bash (Windows), and then browse through this [command line reference](code/03_command_line.md).

### Class 2: Git, Github, and the Command Line

**Class Resources:**
Set your [Git username and email](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-username-in-git/)

**Command Line Resources:**
* Work through GA's friendly [command line tutorial](http://generalassembly.github.io/prework/command-line/#/) using Terminal (Linux/Mac) or Git Bash (Windows).
* [The Linux command line](http://courseweb.pitt.edu/bbcswebdav/institution/Pitt%20Online/MLIS_Pitt_Online/LIS%202600/Intro%20Module/LIS_2600_%20M1_Shotts%202009.pdf)
* If you want to go much deeper into the command line, [Data Science at the Command Line](http://amzn.to/1gSjcvV) is a great book.
The [companion website](http://datascienceatthecommandline.com/) provides installation instructions for a "data science toolbox"
(a virtual machine with many more command line tools), as well as a long reference guide to popular command line tools.
* If you want to do more at the command line with CSV files, try out [csvkit](http://csvkit.readthedocs.org/), which can be installed via 'pip'.

**Git and Markdown Resources:**
* [Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is an excellent book for learning Git. Read the first two chapters to gain a deeper understanding of version control and basic commands.
* [GitHub for Beginners](http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1)
* If you want to practice a lot of Git (and learn many more commands), [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/) looks promising.
* If you want to understand how to contribute on GitHub, you first have to understand [forks and pull requests](http://www.dataschool.io/simple-guide-to-forks-in-github-and-git/).
* [GitRef](http://gitref.org/) is my favorite reference guide for Git commands, and [Git quick reference for beginners](http://www.dataschool.io/git-quick-reference-for-beginners/) is a shorter guide with commands grouped by workflow.
* [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) provides a thorough set of Markdown examples with concise explanations. GitHub's [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) is a simpler and more attractive guide, but is less comprehensive.
* [Introducing GitHub](http://amzn.to/1KCjWg6) is a nice intro to GitHub that reads quickly
* [Version Control with Git](http://amzn.to/1gSkBm2)
* [Cracking the Code to GitHub's Growth](https://growthhackers.com/growth-studies/github) explains why GitHub is so popular among developers.
* [How to remove .DS_Store from GitHub](https://gist.github.com/vybstat/1680bef4715bfbcb0268)
* The simple [Git guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)
