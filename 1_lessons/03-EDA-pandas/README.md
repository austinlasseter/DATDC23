# EDA with Pandas

* Python Fundamentals ([code](./code/python-review.ipynb))

* Pandas ([code](./code/pandas-workshop-starter.ipynb))

**Homework:**
* Read [How Software in Half of NYC Cabs Generates $5.2 Million a Year in Extra Tips](http://iquantny.tumblr.com/post/107245431809/how-software-in-half-of-nyc-cabs-generates-5-2) for an excellent example of exploratory data analysis.
* Read [Anscombe's Quartet, and Why Summary Statistics Don't Tell the Whole Story](http://data.heapanalytics.com/anscombes-quartet-and-why-summary-statistics-dont-tell-the-whole-story/) for a classic example of why visualization is useful.

**Resources:**
* Browsing or searching the Pandas [API Reference](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/api.html) is an excellent way to locate a function even if you don't know its exact name.
* [What I do when I get a new data set as told through tweets](http://simplystatistics.org/2014/06/13/what-i-do-when-i-get-a-new-data-set-as-told-through-tweets/) is a fun (yet enlightening) look at the process of exploratory data analysis.
* [Data School's Pandas series](http://www.dataschool.io/easier-data-analysis-with-pandas/) Thanks, Kevin!
